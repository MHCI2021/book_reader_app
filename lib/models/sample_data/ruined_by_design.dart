  The world is changed by seamstresses like Rosa Parks who refuse to live life as a second-class citizen. The world is changed by electricians like Lech Wałęsa trying to earn a fair wage. The world is changed by girls like Malala Yousafzai who desperately want to go to school. The world is changed by punk activists like Nadya Tolokonnikova, who remind us that “words can break cement.” The world is changed by regular kids like David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, who watched their friends die because previous generations refused to do anything about the gun epidemic. The world is changed by cocky kids like Muhammad Ali, who just want to get their stolen bicycle back. The world is changed by civil servants like Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who refused to be defeated by a political system designed to defeat her.

For years, the libertarian con artists of Silicon Valley have been telling us they want to change the world. But when the people at the top tell you they want to change the world, it’s generally because they’ve figured out how to profit even more from those below them. (To be fair, not even in my wildest dreams did I think even those dirtbags would be okay normalizing fascism to make that happen. Yet here we are.)

I am telling you, we can change the world because there are more of us regular people than there are of them. More importantly, they cannot design the things they imagine without regular people like us. Our labor is what makes us special, and what gives us power. When we turn that labor into a force for making the world better for the largest number of people possible instead of using it to make a few people even richer than they already are? Then, and only then, we may be actually able to change the world. Then we get to go home and live ordinary lives. I am looking forward to it.

Will it be easy? No. But it might just be worth it.





The Ethics of Design





Do no harm.

The Hippocratic oath is one of the oldest known ethical codes in the world, traced back to somewhere in the third century BCE. It was written by Hippocrates, the father of western medicine, who was probably beginning to see doctors doing some weird shit. To be fair, he was probably doing weird shit too, but their shit was just a little weirder. So, he sat down and wrote an oath that all doctors needed to swear to before they started their doctoring. Because he was a persuasive dude, they agreed to swear by it. To this day, doctors take the Hippocratic oath before being issued licenses. Designers have neither a code, nor a license to practice. (Yet. We’re addressing that later.)

Most professions worth their while, and capable of inflicting harm, have ethical codes of some sort. It’s a sign of maturity and responsibility, and there’s a price paid for not following it, which may include losing your license to practice. (See how they’re tied together?) Doctors, lawyers, journalists, Omar from The Wire, even our design cousins the architects all have ethical codes they agree to follow.

Imagine walking into a doctor’s office and demanding oxycodone. No good doctor is going to prescribe that kind of drug without a good reason. (Picture the unsavory ones that would!) Besides common decency, there are two things preventing your doctor from prescribing oxycodone on demand: it goes against their code of ethics (giving a healthy person a drug they don’t need is doing harm), and they’d lose their license if someone finds out. Just as importantly, they’ve been trained to not do that! They know it’s bad for you, they know it’s ethically wrong, and they know they’ll be punished for doing it.

Now imagine your boss running up to your desk and demanding you implement some shitty dark pattern to trick your users into doing something they don’t want to do. How many of you would do it? How many of you know that’s a bad thing to do? How many of you know it’s an unethical demand? Also, how many of your bosses know they’re making an unethical demand? (I guarantee you the addict trying to get oxycodone from the doctor knows what they’re doing is sketchy, making them more honest than your boss.)

How many of you think the two situations aren’t comparable because the money is flowing in reverse? For those that do—wrong. They’re exactly the same. In each situation, someone is demanding that a person who provides a professional service use their skills unethically. If you believe you need to do what your boss wants because they’re paying you, you also need to believe the doctor should provide the oxycodone if the addict is willing to pay for it. The exchange of cash for services doesn’t supersede ethics. Following unethical orders won’t keep you out of jail.

The internet is a harassment and abuse factory in part because designers implemented things they shouldn’t—like Facebook’s ad network that allows advertisers to target by race, and because companies didn’t implement things they should have—like Twitter’s failure to deal with abuse. Whether those designers knew they were behaving unethically is something we may never be able to prove, but we need to at least put a stake in the ground. We can at least take ignorance away as an excuse. We need a code and we need to follow it.

Look, writing this book is placing a bet on hope. There will always be shit-ass designers out there who won’t give a damn about behaving ethically, just as there’ll always be doctors willing to prescribe you that oxy. I am hoping beyond hope, there are designers out there who want desperately to design the right thing and just need a code to follow, a toolkit to use, and professional backup. I am hoping there are more of those than the former. I hope that you are among them.

When I became a designer, I didn’t have to take an oath, pass the bar like a lawyer, or get a license to practice. Chances are, neither did you. All we had to do was convince someone to exchange their money for our design skills and—voila!—we were professional designers. Of course, when I became a designer we were mostly making websites to advertise movies, sell pet food online, and to find other websites. That’s no longer the case. As I write this in 2019, the tech industry is having its moment of panic.

Deservedly so.

We’ve been designing giant world-wide networks that manage personal relationships, generate abuse and harassment, and can’t tell (or don’t care about) the difference between a good or a bad actor. We’re happy to have Nazis on our platforms because they count as engagement. We’re happy to let people post the addresses of parents of slain children because we can sell ads against it. We’re also designing “smart” devices that can listen to and watch everything we do in our homes. These things are being designed by people who have no idea what their professional ethical code is, or any recourse to deal with designers who break it. The work we do has become astonishingly complex in the last twenty years. I don’t just mean technically complex, that was the easy part. I mean ethically complex. Our field has matured and we need to mature along with it.

Fun fact: “Do no harm”, which is the part everyone can quote about the Hippocratic Oath, wasn’t in the original text. It got added much later. Codes are living documents. They evolve. It’s time for us to evolve too.

And yet, if you mention ethical codes to designers they lose their shit. Mention licensing and they go full Lord of the Flies. “We’ll never agree on one. Who’s going to implement it?” I was once called a fascist for suggesting that designers should have a code of ethics. It should freak you out that gangsters can agree on a code of behavior but designers can’t. Crime is more organized than design.

About a year ago, I decided to write a code of ethics. It’s open-sourced. Take it. Make it better. Treat it like a living document:''';
